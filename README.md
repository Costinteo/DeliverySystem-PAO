Delivery System, homework for Advanced Object Oriented Programing

The menu is pretty self-explanatory.
For choosing actions / commands, you have to manually type out each command. It ignores case-sensitivity, for user convenience. Fully typing out commands however, doesn't seem like a good idea for user convenience. But I wanted to do it this way to play around with some java methods and syntax.

In the main method, there's 3 establishments I have hard-coded. This definitely isn't the best way to do it, the best would be reading each establishment from corresponding input files, but for demo purposes, I feel like this is enough.

Another thing that is placeholder are the toString() formatting for each class. It looks clunky and very hard to read, I will be changing that for the next stage.
There's also some comments along the way with the code. The whole class structure could be a little bit better, but overall, I like how it's all turning out so far.

I haven't extensively tested it, because I've basically speedcoded it in a day, I hope there won't be any surprises. But if there are, let me know, I'd appreciate it!
